<h2 id="new--updated-mechanics">New &amp; Updated Mechanics</h2>
<h3 id="general-notes">General Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the rules below, any time an action would require you to spend 15’ or less of movement, you can choose to spend your bonus action instead.
* At the moment this does not change pre-existing 5e rules for balance. It still takes half of your movement to stand up from Prone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="credits-currency">Credits (Currency)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The currency used is &quot;Credits&quot; denoted with &quot;₡&quot;. 1 credit is equivalent to 1 copper in original 5e.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="power-cells">Power Cells</h3>
<ul>
<li>Power Cells are batteries which can be attached to any weapon.
<ul>
<li>All weapons have a slot somewhere where an energy cell can be placed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All weapons can have one Power Cell equipped at a time.</li>
<li>Energy Weapons require a Power Cell to operate, and their damage type is entirely dependent on the equipped Power Cell.</li>
<li>Purchasing a Power Cell for a weapon costs 50% of the weapon’s base value.</li>
<li>Equipping a new Power Cell takes an action, and can only be done if it is in your Chest Rig or Utility Belt.</li>
<li>'Charging' (Reloading) a Power Cell for any weapon costs 15’ of movement.
<ul>
<li>Energy guns must be charged after shooting a number of times equal to their ‘Charge’ value</li>
<li>Melee weapons must be charged after two uses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Activating a Power Cell on a melee weapon is a free action (must be done on your turn). For the duration of the round, the weapon becomes a +1 weapon and the damage type of the swing is converted to the energy type of the power cell.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="energy-weapons-firearms">Energy Weapons (Firearms)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Energy Weapons replace the default Gun mechanics in 5e.</li>
<li>Energy Weapons require a Power Cell to operate, and their damage type is entirely dependent on the Power Cell they have equipped.</li>
<li>Energy Weapons do not get less accurate at range, but their potency drops off quickly. Range thresholds for Energy Weapons dictate this damage drop-off. Hitting a target beyond the first threshold deals 50% damage. Hitting a target beyond the second threshold deals no damage.</li>
<li>Energy Weapons must be charged after shooting a number of times equal to their ‘Charge’ value. This requires spending 15’ of movement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vitality-stimulants--short-rests">Vitality Stimulants &amp; Short Rests</h3>
<p>Short rests cannot be done in hostile territory. Instead, the players must use a one time injection item called a ‘Vitality Stimulant’ (VS). The VS can be used as an action, has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player gets to take an immediate and instant short rest which otherwise conforms to all the standard 5e rules.</li>
<li>The player gains one level of Exhaustion for a number of minutes according to their new current Exhaustion level.
<ul>
<li>For example, a character with 2 exhaustion who uses a VS will increase their exhaustion level to 3 for 3 minutes before returning to exhaustion level 2.
<ul>
<li>This doesn’t count if you increase exhaustion to level 6. You just die like an idiot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You cannot use a VS while recovering from a previous VS use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weapon--armor-mods">Weapon &amp; Armor Mods</h3>
<p>Mods are upgrades that can be placed on a weapon or armor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each Mod takes up a certain number of ‘slots’ on the weapon or armor you attach it to.</li>
<li>Armor Slots are defined in the Armor spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Weapon Slots follow this formula:
<ul>
<li>Weapons with the ‘Light’ attribute have 1 mod slot.</li>
<li>Weapons with the ‘Heavy’ or ‘Two-Handed’ attribute have 3 mod slots.</li>
<li>All other weapons have 2 mod slots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some mods require a lot of time &amp; effort to remove, others can be swapped during combat.</li>
<li>Power Cells are not considered Mods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chest-rigs--utility-belts">Chest Rigs &amp; Utility Belts</h3>
<p>Items that can be used in combat must first be placed in a Chest Rig or on a Utility Belt. This includes sidearms &amp; alternate weapons, power cells, swappable weapon and armor mods, gear you wish to have quick access to, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes an action to move an item from another container to your rig/belt.</li>
<li>It takes 10’ of movement to add a loose item to your rig/belt.</li>
<li>Chest Rigs and Utility Belts are purchased separately from your armor.</li>
<li>Weapons with the ‘concealable’ property do not take up a slot when placed in a rig or belt, and are still considered concealed</li>
<li><strong>RP NOTE:</strong> Chest Rigs will draw much more attention from guards and enforcers than utility belts and many types of armor. Many people who see you wearing a chest rig (especially a kitted one) will assume you are prepared to enter combat at any moment. Wearing clothing or otherwise concealing a chest rig until you are ready for combat is always a good idea.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sundering--repairing">Sundering &amp; Repairing</h3>
<p>Any character can attempt to sunder an item or piece of gear the enemy is wearing or has in their chest rig/utility belt by attacking with disadvantage. An item that is hit by a Sundering Attack becomes 'damaged' and will no longer function until it is Repaired. Repairing can be done with a Repair Kit. If an item is already damaged and is Sundered again, it is destroyed and will require specialized tools and more time to repair.</p>
<ul>
<li>Weapons, armor, chest rigs, utility belts, and implants cannot be sundered.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implants">Implants</h3>
<p>Implants replace the mechanic of attuned magic items. Each character can have a maximum of three implants by default just as with attuned items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implants can essentially have any effect that magic items do in 5e.</li>
<li>Implants are designed to be consumer friendly, but more powerful Implants will require major parts of the body to be heavily modified or replaced.</li>
<li>Unlike attunement items, it takes a 1 hour surgical operation and 10,000₡ to remove a basic Implant. More powerful implants can take much more time and money depending on which parts of the body must be regenerated.
<ul>
<li>This surgical operation can be performed by characters who have maxed out the Biology knowledge skill.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new--updated-content">New &amp; Updated Content</h2>
<h3 id="armor">Armor</h3>
<p>Many of the armor sets in the Armor Table are directly converted from 5e. Players can buy any standard 5e armor now listed in the Armor Table for the standard price.</p>
<h4 id="armor-table">Armor Table</h4>

<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
<p>Skills have been reworked. There are now two types of Skills, Performance Skills and Knowledge Skills.</p>
<h4 id="performance-skills">Performance Skills</h4>
<p>Performance skills require your character to successfully perform a specific task or challenge. They function exactly the same as in 5e.</p>
<ul>
<li>Skills listed with (XX / XX) require the player to choose which stat to use at lvl 1.</li>
<li>Skills listed with (XX &amp; XX) will change which attribute must be used depending on the situation.
<ul>
<li>For example: a Security check to try and analyze encrypted data would require and INT check, while a Security check to pick a lock would require a DEX check.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="knowledge-skills">Knowledge Skills</h4>
<p>Knowledge Skills represent areas of general knowledge your character possesses. Having a high score in a Knowledge Skill allows your character to glean important information they would otherise miss.</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not make rolls using Knowledge Skills.</li>
<li>You start at level 0 in a Knowledge Skill and level it up to a maximum of 5.</li>
<li>Each time you level up, you gain 1 point to spend on any Knowledge Skill that can be leveled.</li>
<li>Your level in a Knowledge Skill canot exceed your own level / 2 (you must be level 10 before you can reach level 5 in any Knowledge Skill).</li>
<li>You may only spend points in a number of different Knowledge Skills equal to your current INT mod (+3 INT mod toons can put points into 3 different Knowledge Skills).</li>
<li>Reaching max level in a Knowledge Skill grants the associated perk.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="droids">Droids</h4>
<p>Droids are humanoid robots with some level of AI. They vary greatly in sophistication depending on what they were designed for. All droids possess an biological internal processor which allows them to perform spontaneous decision making and greatly enhances their ability to communicate with organic lifeforms.</p>
<h5 id="droid-traits">Droid Traits</h5>
<ul>
<li>+2 CON score</li>
<li>Base walking speed 30'</li>
<li>Immune to poison, disease</li>
<li>Cannot drown or suffocate</li>
<li>Advantage vs Charmed and Frightened</li>
<li>Cannot use magic</li>
<li>Cannot swim without special gear or mods (sinks at 50' /round if in water.)</li>
<li>Can be Small or Medium
<ul>
<li>If small, 100-200 lbs, 2-3' tall</li>
<li>If medium, 300-500 lbs 4-7' tall</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Droids will Overload if they take too much lightning damage (see Overloading)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="overloading">Overloading</h5>
<ul>
<li>If a droid takes lightning damage &gt;= their current level from a single source (attack, spell, trap, etc), they 'Overload' and must perform a partial reboot to continue functioning correctly.
<ul>
<li>Roll 1d4 to determine an additional effect for 1d4 rounds:
<ul>
<li>1: Move speed becomes 15'</li>
<li>2: Disadvantage on skill checks</li>
<li>3: Disadvantage on attack rolls</li>
<li>4: Disadvantage on saving throws</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you roll an effect you already have from this source, reroll the 1d4 until you get a new effect.</li>
<li>If a droid takes accumulates 3/4 of the effects from Overload, they must perform an immediate emergency reboot. They lose all effects of Overload immediately, and become Paralyzed for 1d4 rounds until their reboot is completed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="downed-rules">Downed Rules</h5>
<ul>
<li>When a droid goes down, they do not need to roll death throws. They can still suffer from instant death as normal.</li>
<li>All damage taken after reaching 0 HP, including damage from the initial hit that downs the droid, must be healed before the droid can regain consciousness.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="repairing">Repairing</h5>
<ul>
<li>Droids cannot be healed using Vitality Stimulants, healing spells, or Healing Stimulants. They must be healed using Repair Kits, or by certain magical spells:
<ul>
<li>Mending cantrip can restore 1 HP to a robot per cast.</li>
<li>Fabricate spell heals robot equal to 50% of it's max HP value + the caster's spell mod.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
